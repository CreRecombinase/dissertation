* Functional Genetics by Expectation Maximization Project 
Plan is for this chapter to consist of a submitted paper (targeting Bioinformatics).
** Write Paper 
   DEADLINE: <2020-05-13 Wed>
*** TODO Finish analyses
    DEADLINE: <2020-05-04 Mon>
**** TODO [#A] Run FGEM on new set of genes
     DEADLINE: <2020-05-01 Fri>
**** TODO [#B] Make a decision about collinearity issue
     DEADLINE: <2020-04-30 Thu>
+ FGEM currently can't handle collinearity in the gene annotations
+ Possible solutions (from easiest to hardest):
  + Add a check for collinear features 
  + Fit model via stochastic minibatch gradient descent (would need to come up with a new name because it would no longer be "Functional Genetics by Expectation Maximization")
  + Prior on $\Beta$


* Polygenic RSS
As it stands there will probably more than one paper's worth of work to be written up for this project
by the time it is finished. The current plan is for this project is to get one paper out of the project
and for the rest of the work to go in the dissertation.

**** TODO [#A] Finish UK-Biobank Simulations
     DEADLINE: <2020-05-22 Fri>
+ Complete with vs without ldetect/ldshrink single-chromosome simulations
**** TODO [#B] Finish UK-biobank/Genbank GWAS real-data analysis

**** TODO [#B] Figure out what to do about inflated $\hat{h^2}$ estimate at high $h^2$
     I have a few hypotheses about what's causing the inflation:
